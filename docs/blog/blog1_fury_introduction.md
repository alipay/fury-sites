# Background

Serialization is basic components of system communication, and is widely used in big data, AI framework, cloud native and
other distributed systems. When the object needs to be transferred between processes/languages/nodes, or needs
persistence, state read/write, copy, they all need serialization. Its performance and ease-of-use affect runtime and
development efficiency.

Static serialization frameworks such as Â· cannot be directly used for cross-language development of domain objects due
to their inability to support object reference and polymorphism, as well as the need for pre-generating code. Dynamic
serialization frameworks such as JDK serialization, Kryo, Fst, Hessian, Pickle provide ease-of-use and dynamics, but do
not support cross-language and have significant performance issues, which cannot meet the demands of high throughput,
low latency, and large-scale data transmission scenarios.

Therefore, we developed a new multi-language serialization framework [Fury](https://github.com/alipay/fury), which is
now open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/alipay/fury). Through highly optimized serialization primitives,
combined with JIT dynamic compilation and Zero-Copy technologies, Fury meets the requirements of performance,
functionality, and ease-of-use simultaneously, archives automatic cross-language serialization of any object and provides
ultimate performance.

# What is Fury

Fury is a multi-language serialization framework powered by JIT dynamic compilation and zero copy, providing blazing
fast speed and ease of use:

- **Multiple languages**: Java/Python/C++/Golang/JavaScript/Rust, other languages can be added easily.
- Highly optimized **serialization primitives**.
- **Zero-Copy**: support out-of-band serialization and off-heap read/write.
- **High performance**: Use JIT(just-in-time) to generate serialization instructions at runtime in an async multithreaded way, which can inline more methods, code cache, eliminate dead code, hash lookup, meta writing and memory read/writing.
- **Multi protocols**: providing flexibility and ease-of-use of dynamic serialization, as well as the cross-language capability of static serialization.
  - **Java Serialization**:
    - Drop-in replaces `JDK/Kryo/Hessian`, no need to modify user code, but providing 170x speed up at most, which can
      improve efficiency of rpc, data transfer and object persistence significantly.
    - 100% JDK compatible, support JDK custom serialization
      methods `writeObject/readObject/writeReplace/readResolve/readObjectNoData` natively.
  - **Cross-language object graph**:
    - Cross-language serialize any objects automatically, no need for IDL, schema compilation, and code/protocol
      conversion.
    - Cross-language serialize shared/circular reference, no data duplication or recursion error.
    - Support object polymorphism, multiple children type objects can be serialized simultaneously.
  - **Row format**
    - A cache-friendly binary random-access format, support skipping deserialization and lazy deserialization, better
      option for high-performance computing and large-scale data transfer.
    - Support automatic conversion to apache arrow.

# Core Serialization Capabilities

Although different scenarios require different serialization frameworks, the underlying operations of serialization are
similar. Therefore, Fury defines and implements a set of basic serialization capabilities, which can be used for quickly building
new multi-language serialization protocols and get speedup by jit acceleration
and other optimization techniques. At the same time, performance optimization for a protocol on the basic capabilities can also benefit all serialization protocols.

## Serialization Primitives
Common serialization operations contains:
- bitmap operations
- number encoding/decoding
- int/long compression
- String creation/copy
- String encoding: ASCII/UTF8/UTF16
- memory copy
- array copy&compression
- meta encoding&compression&cache

Fury made many optimizations in every language, combined with SIMD and advanced language features, we made basic operations extremely fast.

## Zero-Copy Serialization

In large-scale data transfer scenarios, an object graph often has multiple binary buffers. Other serialization framework will write the binary into an intermediate buffer and introduces multiple time-consuming memory
copies. Fury implemented an out-of-band serialization protocol inspired by [pickle5](https://peps.python.org/pep-0574/), ray and arrow, which can
capture all binary buffers in an object graph to avoid intermediate copies of these buffers, thus avoiding the memory copy cost during serialization.

The following figure shows the serialization process of zero-copy when turning off fury reference support.

<img alt="fury zero copy" src="/fury_zero_copy.jpeg">

Currently, Fury supports the following types of zero-copy:

- java: all basic types of arrays, `ByteBuffer`, `ArrowRecordBatch`, and `VectorSchemaRoot`
- python: all arrays of the array module, numpy arrays, `pyarrow.Table,` and `pyarrow.RecordBatch`
- golang:byte slice

You can also add the new zero copy type based on the Fury interface.

## JIT dynamic compilation acceleration

Custom type objects usually contain lots of type information, Fury used this information to generate
efficient serialization code at runtime, then lots of runtime operations are completed in the dynamic compilation
stage, by inlining more method, better code cache, reducing virtual method calls, conditional branches, hash lookup,
metadata writes, and memory reads/writes finally, the serialization performance is greatly accelerated.

For Java, Fury implements a runtime codegen framework and defines a serialization
logic [operator expression IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation). Then fury performs type inference based
on the generic type information of the object at runtime and build an expression tree that describes the logic of
serialized code. The codegen framework will generates efficient Java code from the expression tree, and then pass
to [Janino](https://github.com/janino-compiler/janino) to compile it into bytecode, and load it into the user's
ClassLoader or the ClassLoader created by Fury, and finally compile it into efficient assembly code through Java JIT.

Since JVM JIT skips Big method compilation and inlining, Fury also implements an optimizer to split big methods into
small methods recursively, thus ensuring that all code can be compiled and inlined.

<img alt="fury java codegen" src="/fury_java_codegen.png">

Fury also supports asynchronous multithreaded compilation by submitting the code generation tasks to a thread pool, and using interpretation mode until JIT finishes to ensure no serialization burrs. Users can skip warm up serialization of objects.

For Python and JavaScript, codegen processes are similar. Generating is easier for development and troubleshooting problems.

Since serialization will manipulate objects extensively in each programming language, and the language
does not expose the low-level API of the memory model, native methods call has a large cost too, we cannot
use [LLVM](https://www.llvm.org/) to build a unified serializer JIT framework. Instead, we must implement a code
generation framework for every language separately.

## Static code generation

Although JIT compilation can greatly improve serialization efficiency and generate better serialization code based on the statistical distribution of data at runtime, languages such as C ++ do not support reflection, no virtual
machines, and no low-level API for memory models. Therefore, we cannot dynamically generate serialization code for such languages through JIT.

In this scenario, Fury is implementing an AOT codegen framework, which generates the serialized code statically according to the object schema, and objects can be serialized automatically using the
generated serializer. For Rust, Rust macro is used to generate code statically.

## Cache optimization
When serializing a custom type, fury will **reorder fields** to ensure that fields of the same type are serialized in order. This can hit more data cache and CPU instruction cache.

The basic type fields are written in descending order by byte size. In this way, if the initial addresses are aligned,
subsequent read and write operations will occur at the position where the memory addresses are aligned, making CPU execution more efficient.

# Multi-protocol Design and Implementation

Based on the multi-language serialization features provided by Fury core, we have built three serialization protocols for different scenarios:

- **Java serialization**: suitable for pure Java serialization scenarios and provides 170x performance improvement at most;
- **Cross-language object graph serialization**: suitable for application-oriented multi-language programming and high-performance cross-language serialization;
- **Row-format serialization**: suitable for distributed computing engines such as Spark/Flink/Dories/Velox/Features framework;

In the future, we will add new protocols for other core scenarios. Users can also build their own protocols based on Fury's serialization features.

## Java serialization

Due to the wide use of Java in big data, cloud native, microservices, and enterprise applications, the performance optimization of Java serialization can reduce system latency, improves throughput and reduces server costs significantly.

Therefore, Fury made a lot of performance optimizations for Java serialization. Our implementation has the following highlights:

- Blazing Performance : Based on Java object types and generics, combined with JIT compilation and Unsafe low-level operations, **Fury is 170x faster than JDK, and 50~100x faster than Kryo/Hessian** at most.
- **100% JDK serialization API compatibility** : supports all JDK custom serialization
  methods. `writeObject/readObject/writeReplace/readResolve/readObjectNoData` to ensure the correctness of JDK
  serialization in any scenario. Existing Java serialization frameworks, such as Kryo/Hessian, have some correctness
  problems in these scenarios.
- **Type compatibility**: When the deserialization and serialization Class Schema are inconsistent, it can still be
  deserialized correctly. It supports independent application upgrade and deployment, add or delete fields
  independently. We made much optimization, the type compatible mode has no performance loss compared to type consistent
  mode.
- **Metadata sharing** : under a certain context (TCP connection) share metadata among multiple serializations (Class name,
  field name, Final field type information, etc.), this information will be sent to the peer during the first
  serialization, the peer can reconstruct the same deserializer based on this type of information. Subsequent
  serialization can avoid transmitting metadata, reduce network traffic pressure, and support type compatibility
  automatically.
- **Zero copy support**: supports Out-of-band zero copy and off-heap memory read/write.

## Cross-language object graph serialization

Fury cross-language object graph serialization is primarily used in scenarios that require higher levels of dynamics and
usability. Although frameworks like Protobuf/Flatbuffers support cross-language serialization, they still have
limitations:

- They require **pre-defined IDLs and generate code statically ahead**, lacking sufficient dynamics and flexibility;
- The generated classes **don't conform to object-oriented design** and it's impossible to add behavior to classes, which
  make them unsuitable for use as domain objects in cross-language application development.
- They **don't support polymorphism** serialization. Object-oriented programming uses interfaces to invoke subclass methods,
  but this pattern isn't supported well in those frameworks. Although Flatbuffers offers `Union`, and Protobuf
  provides `OneOf/Any` features, these features require check object type during serialization and deserialization,
  which isn't polymorphic.
- They **don't support circular references and shared references**. For such cases, users need to define a set of IDLs for
  domain objects and implement reference resolution by themselves, as well as writing code to convert between domain objects and protocol objects in each language. If the object graph depth is deep, more code needs to be written.

Due to the above limitations, Fury implemented a cross-language object graph serialization protocol that:

- **Automatically serializes any object across multiple languages**: By defining classes in the serialization and
  deserialization peer, objects in one language can be automatically serialized into objects in another language without
  creating IDL files, compiling schema to generate code, or writing conversion code.
- **Automatically serializes shared and circular references** across multiple languages.
- **Supports object type polymorphism**, consistent with the object-oriented programming paradigm, and multiple subtypes can
  be automatically deserialized without manual intervention.
- **Out-of-band zero-copy** is also supported in this protocol.

Example of Automatic Cross-Language Serialization:

## Row-format

For **high-performance computing and large-scale data transfer** scenarios, data serialization and transfer are often
the **performance bottlenecks** of the system. If users only need to read part of the data or filter data based on some
field of an object, deserializing the entire data will result in additional overhead. Therefore, Fury also provides a
binary data structure for **direct reading and writing on binary data to avoid serialization**.

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a mature columnar storage format that supports binary read and write.
However, columnar storage cannot meet all scenario requirements. In online and streaming computing scenarios, data is
naturally stored in row structures, and row format is also used in columnar computing engines when involving data
updates, Hash/Join/Aggregation operations.

However, there is no standardized implementation for row format. Computing engines such as Spark/Flink/Doris/Velox all
defined their row format, which doesn't support cross-language and can only be used internally by themselves. Although
Flatbuffers supports on-demand deserialization, it requires static compilation of Schema IDL and management of offset,
which cannot meet the dynamics and ease-of-use requirements of complex scenarios.

Therefore, Fury referenced the design
of [Spark Tungsten](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/28/project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal.html)
and [Apache Arrow format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html), implemented a binary row format that
allows random access and partial deserialization. Currently, Java/Python/C++ versions have been implemented, allowing
direct reading and writing on binary data to avoid all serialization overhead.

<img alt="xlang serialization example" src="/row_format.png">
This format is densely stored, byte aligned and cache-friendly, which enables faster read and write operations. By avoiding deserialization, it reduces Java GC pressure and Python overhead. Based on Python's dynamics, Fury's data structure implements special methods such as `getattr_/getitem/slice` and others, ensuring behavior consistency with Python dataclass/list/object, and users have no perception of this.

# Performance Comparison

Here are some Java serialization performance data, where charts with "compatible" in the title are performance data
under type compatible mode: support type forward/backward compatibility.
and charts without "compatible" in the title are performance data without type compatibility: class schema must be same
between serialization and deserialization. For fairness, Fury disabled the zero-copy feature for all tests.
